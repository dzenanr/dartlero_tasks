# Tasks application with dartlero

**Categories**: education, class models.

**Concepts**: Project, Employee, Task.

**Description**:
A model example with a [many-to-many relationship] 
(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OOYUa5wX6IjGIBD1KuSEpec1p_unIbzE4JFvPL5ULxA/edit?usp=sharing) 
between Project and Employee.

**Start**:
Clone the project and open it with Dart Editor.

In the Run/Manage Launches of Dart Editor, enter the two arguments in the 
dartlero_tasks.dart command-line launch:

--dir path 

Example:

--dir C:/Users/ridjanod/git/dart/educ

By running the main function in the bin/dartlero_tasks.dart file, a model, 
with two entry points, will be initialized (and saved) in the given directory. 
For each entry concept, a file with the concept name and the json extension 
will be created. The next time, data from the two files will be loaded.

You may open a file with a text editor. Use a 
[JSON pretty-printer] (http://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/) 
to examine the json document.
